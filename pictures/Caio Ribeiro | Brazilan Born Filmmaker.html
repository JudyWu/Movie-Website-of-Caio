    Introduction to Caio, the filmmaker

Caio Ribeiro is a native of Brazil. After growing up in several
countries, Caio settled in New York City in 1988, where he attended film
school at Brooklyn College, and thereafter started his career as a
filmmaker. While working as a cameraman and gaffer, Caio directed his
first short film, "Ballad for Two Lovers", winner of the best director's
award at the Huy Film Festival in Belgium. In 1998 Caio directed his
first feature film, "Sometime in August", an official selection at the
Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, The Florida Independent Film
Festival, and nominated for the Starfish Award at The Hamptons Film
Festival, for best American independent feature of the year. From 1999
to 2004, Caio wrote and was the director of photography of the World War
II films, "Letters from the Dead" and "The Fallen". Both films were
winners of multiple awards throughout the world and found worldwide
distribution. In 2007 Caio started working on the series "The Realm", a
close relative of the Twilight Zone, and has completed the first three
episodes.


    Sometime In August

*A lonely woman hires a private investigator to find out who she really
is.*

Marcia, a thirty something New Yorker, has just been dumped once again.
Lonely and desperate that she is nobody's type, she hires a private
investigator to follow and evaluate her in the hopes that can help her
recreate herself into someone a man can love. Then, while disguising
herself, Marcia meets the P.I. only to hear his dismal report of how he
finds her to be a self-centered and altogether uninteresting woman,
confirming her deepest fears about herself. The P.I., in reality, a
soulful drunk Russian poet, who makes ends meet by taking advantage of
the neediness of his clients, watches as a desperate Marcia starts to
reinvent herself into a new woman, who tries to impress him at any cost.
Igor, in the meanwhile, starts to fall in love with the real Marcia she
is so determined to hide from him.

In this world of ours,
We eat only to cast out,
Sleep only to wake
And what comes after all that?
Is simply to die at last.
The old pond-
a frog jumps in,
sound of water.

What fish feel,
birds feel, I don't know--
the year ending.

First day of spring--
I keep thinking about
the end of autumn.
