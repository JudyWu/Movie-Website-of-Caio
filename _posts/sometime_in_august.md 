"Sometime in August" was originally released in 1999. Starring Michael Medeiros as Igor and Sylva Kelegian as Marcia, this gentle and quirky romantic comedy did well on the festival circuit but fell short of a distribution deal. Newly recut to 59 minutes by its writer and director, Caio Ribeiro, "Sometime in August" is now being released on the internet for the first time.
