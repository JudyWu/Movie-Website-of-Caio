"If you saw Ari Taub's World War II drama 'The Fallen' when it was released in New York in 2006, then you know how his new World War II drama, 'Last Letters From Monte Rosa,' ends. You also have a pretty good idea of how it begins, and what comes in between. That's because they're essentially the same movie." Movie review from [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/movies/06last.html).
